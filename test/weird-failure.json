The last proposal thread was quite hard to follow. Having something like loomio would hopefully make it easier for people to engage.\n\n## Why would I be good at it?\n\nI built patch-gatherings which taught me how to make patch-core plugins. I work with [@mix](@ye+QM09iPcDJD6YvQYjoQc7sLF/IFhmNbEqgdzQo3lQ=.ed25519) (worked at loomio), and in the same space as [@robguthrie](@sruvKFMpjwK9mdktJzYOSHcb+yd1v7zqzpVUId/iJQ0=.ed25519) (still works at loomio) so I can pick their brains.\n\nI'm also super excited to work on this. Actually, not quite as excited as writing rust modules for ssb, but I think the community needs ssb-loomio more than it needs faster modules right now. And [@Aljoscha](@zurF8X68ArfRM71dF3mKh36W0xDM8QmOnAS5bYOq8hA=.ed25519) already has a rad proposal for this underway.\n\n## Timescale\n\nI'd hope to spread this over 2 months.\n\n## Possible features\n\nI've lifted the definitions straight from loomio's site. :)\nI can't build all these in that amount of time but am interested in people's opinions about which ones are most exciting.\n\n### Poll \n\nUse a poll to measure popularity or offer a choice.\nProvide some options to choose from. Decide if participants choose single or multiple options as their response.\nEveryone votes, and can enter a statement too if they like. Results are represented in a bar graph.\n\n### Ranked choice\n\nRanked choice is a voting method which allows each voter to respond with their preferences in order.\nIt's preferable when 'vote stealing' is a concern (ie, two somewhat popular options are similar enough that they end up sharing votes between them), and can be used to implement a Condorcet, or Instant Runoff style election.\n\n### Dot vote\n\nDot voting is a way to prioritise a list of options.\nParticipants are given a limited number of ‘dots’ which they can allocate however they like among the options provided to represent their own preferences.\nThe totals of the results are shown, as well as and the individual votes, so you can consider various points of view.\n\n### Check\n\nA check is a tool with many possible uses but only 2 responses: a tick (✔) or an x mark (✘). Participants will use the tick (✔) to say yes and the x mark (✘) to say no or unsure.\nUse it to engage people with an offer, like an RSVP: \"I'm coming to the ",
